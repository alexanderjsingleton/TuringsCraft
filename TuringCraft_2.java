// Given  that the variables  x and y have already  been declared  and assigned  values , write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if x is non-negative and y is negative.


// Instructor Notes:
// Here is the solution for you to enter.  Since an expression is asked for, no ";" is required.  "&&" is the Java syntax for the logical operator and
// x>=0 && y<0

x>=0 && y<0

// Given  two variables , isEmpty of type  boolean , indicating whether  a class  roster is empty or not, and numberOfCredits of type  int , containing the number of credits for a class , write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if the class  roster is empty or the class  is exactly three credits.


// Instructor Notes:
// Here is solution for you to enter.  In java "||" is the logical operator or.  No ";" since an expression.
//                    isEmpty || numberOfCredits==3
// Note isEmpty is a simpler way to test if the variable isEmpty has a true value.
// Instead of just isEmpty try the expression isEmpty == true and you should also a correct answer
// Also experiment by using "=" instead of "==" and note the result

isEmpty || numberOfCredits==3

// Write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if and only if the value  of the integer  variable  x is equal  to zero.

x == 0

// Write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if and only if the variables  profits and losses are exactly equal .


// Instructor Notes:
// Recall that in Java the logical operator that tests for equality is ==

profits == losses

// Write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if the value  of index is greater than  the value  of lastIndex.

index > lastIndex

// Working overtime is defined as having worked more than 40 hours during the week. Given  the variable  hoursWorked, write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if the employee worked overtime.

hoursWorked > 40


// Given  the variables  numberOfMen and numberOfWomen, write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if the number of men is greater than  or equal  to the number of women.
numberOfMen >= numberOfWomen

// Given  a double  variable  called average, write an expression  that is true  if and only if the variable 's value  is less than  60.0.

average < 60.0

// Given  an int  variable  grossPay, write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if and only if the value  of grossPay is less than  10,000.

grossPay < 10000

// Given  the variables  temperature and humidity, write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if and only if the temperature is greater than  90 and the humidity is less than  10.


// Instructor Notes:
// Recall that in Java the logical operator and is &&

temperature > 90 && humidity < 10


// Given  the integer  variables  yearsWithCompany and department, write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if yearsWithCompany is less than  5 and department is not equal  to 99.


// Instructor Notes:
// Recall that in Java the logical operator not equal is !=

yearsWithCompany < 5 && department != 99

// Given  that the variables  x and y have already  been declared  and assigned  values , write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if x is positive (including zero) or y is negative.

x >= 0 || y < 0

// Given  the variables  isFullTimeStudent and age, write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if age is less than  19 or isFullTimeStudent is true .

age < 19 || isFullTimeStudent == true

// Write an expression  that evaluates  to true  if and only if value  of the boolean  variable  isAMember is false .

isAMember == false
